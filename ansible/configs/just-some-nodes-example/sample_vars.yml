# sample vars configuration file 
#
# This file is passed to ansible-playbook to set key vars which need to be set
# and typically customized for a sucessful deployment.
#
# Usage: ansible-playbook main.yml -e @configs/three-tier-app/sample_vars.yml
#
# Ideally make and keep a copy OUTSIDE your repo, especially if using Cloud Credentials
# Credentials can also be set seperately i.e. ~/secrets.yml and passed in with
# a 2nd `-e` argument i.e. -e ~/secrets.yml

env_type: just-some-nodes-example                # Name of config to deploy
output_dir: /tmp/workdir                # Writable working scratch directory
email: name@example.com                 # User info for notifications

guid: faz-blah                          # Your Global UNIQUE Identifier
subdomain_base_suffix: .sandbox60.opentlc.com  # Your domain used with guid in FQDN

# Path to your yum repos



# Cloud specfic settings - example given here for AWS

cloud_provider: ec2                     # Which AgnosticD Cloud Provider to use
aws_region: eu-central-1                   # AWS Region to deploy in
HostedZoneId: Z1VEEC8B3WKWIK            # You will need to change this
key_name: ocpworkshop                        # Keyname must exist in AWS

# AWS Credentials. These are required (don't sync them to your fork)
#
# Alternatively consider keeping these in an external file and including:
# $ ansible-playbook main.yml -e @configs/three-tier-app/sample.yml -e @~/secret.yml
#
# aws_access_key_id: 
# aws_secret_access_key:
